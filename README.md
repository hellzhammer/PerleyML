# Perley_ML_Core_Project

This repo is a passion project. I wanted to know more about the agorithms I was using in ML.

There is still work to do but this project has a Ordinary least squares linear regression function, 
binary and multinomial logistic regression. A matrix class that needs extending but handles most standard 
operations (x, -, +, /) as well as some other functions like pointwise and matrix exponent functions. 
All code seems to be working when I compare to math.net or run through the math by hand, so I hope that is a good sign ;) lol.

I will add a license at some point, but the code in this repo is free to abuse and redistribute in any way you want. 

Maybe add a reference to me in your comments? I would go for that, even if its letting the next dev know who to email and blame! xD
